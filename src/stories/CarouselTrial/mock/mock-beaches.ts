        price: 10000,
        category: "France",
        descriptionPrimary: "Sitting at the bottom of a steep, sparsely populated road—Gouverneur is remote and pristine. A small, well-maintained parking lot comes courtesy of the privately owned land (none other than Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich). Access to the sand is through a small, shady grove of trees—a popular spot for picnics at the eastern end of the beach. The farther west you walk, the fewer people you'll find.",
        descriptionSecondary: "Where to Stay: Le Barthélemy Hotel & Spa ranked the best in all of the Caribbean this year. The latest addition to St. Barts' luxury hotel scene, and in keeping with the island's low-rise sensibility, this is a sophisticated winner. Set between a lagoon and Grand Cul-de-Sac beach along the island's northeastern shore (with jaw-dropping views of offshore islets and distant St. Maarten/St. Martin), the hotel is an education in understated elegance.",

        price: 20000,
        category: "Philippines",
        descriptionPrimary: "Boracay is a screensaver brought to life, with dazzling white sand, so-clear-you-can-see-your-toes water, and a lush jungle backdrop, available to anyone willing to make the journey. The island used to fly under the radar with one of the most beautiful beaches in the world—but the secret's out. Now the three-mile White Beach, with its grottos and beachside dining (and nightlife), is its busiest swath of sand. Start your evening at Restaurant Sirena",
        descriptionSecondary: "Where to stay: Sitting pretty on a 30-acre property, Shangri-La's Boracay Resort & Spa opened its doors in 2009. The main building is an open pavilion with a pitched roof and an exterior of local coral stone. Public areas create a sense of place with ten-foot-high tribal drums, carved wooden sculptures, and local art. Room interiors showcase handwoven textiles, sconces made of local capiz shells, and oars framed as art.",

        category: "Seychelles",
        descriptionPrimary: "With its jet-black shore, electric-blue waters, and thick, jungle-like foliage, Honokalani Beach is a photographer’s dream. Besides lying lazily on the “sand”—actually made up of tiny lava pebbles—there’s plenty to do: you’ll find seaside lava tubes and sea caves carved into the lava cliffs along the shore. It’s wild, unspoiled Hawaii at its best, and a necessary stop en route to Hana.",
        descriptionSecondary: "Where to stay: North Island, a Luxury Collection Resort, is a beach-breaker of hearts. Just 11 fantasy villas here are set along a sensational lick of white sand splendor. Each thatched villa has been crafted from local stone, glass, and rescued wood into 5,000 square feet of Robinson Crusoe luxe that includes marble baths, writing nooks, indoor and outdoor showers, plunge pools, Internet access, and en-suite kitchens (a chef comes to you).",
